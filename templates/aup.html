<h1>ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>Last reviewed February 24, 2026</strong></p>

<p>This acceptable use policy covers the products, services, and technologies (collectively referred to
as the "Products") provided by <strong>Kimberly Hudnall, trading as SiteVac</strong> under any ongoing
agreement. It's designed to protect us, our customers and the general Internet community from unethical,
irresponsible and illegal activity.</p>

<p>SiteVac customers found engaging in activities prohibited by this acceptable use policy can be liable
for service suspension and account termination. In extreme cases, we may be legally obliged to report
such customers to the relevant authorities.</p>

<p>This Acceptable Use Policy was created with GetTerms' acceptable use policy generator and adapted for SiteVac.</p>

<h2>Fair Use</h2>

<p>We provide our facilities with the assumption your use will be "business as usual", as per our offer
schedule. If your use is considered to be excessive, then additional fees may be charged or capacity
may be restricted.</p>

<p>We are opposed to all forms of abuse, discrimination, rights infringement and/or any action that
harms or disadvantages any group, individual or resource. We expect our customers and, where applicable,
their users ("end-users") to likewise engage our Products with similar intent.</p>

<h2>Scraping Restrictions</h2>

<p>SiteVac provides web scraping functionality on behalf of its users. The following rules apply to all
scraping activity conducted through SiteVac:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Users may only use SiteVac to scrape websites they own or have explicit permission to scrape.</li>
  <li>Users are solely responsible for ensuring their use complies with the terms of service of any
  website they scrape.</li>
  <li>SiteVac may not be used to scrape websites that prohibit automated access in their terms of
  service or robots.txt file.</li>
  <li>SiteVac may not be used to scrape websites for the purpose of harvesting personal data,
  email addresses, or any information in violation of applicable privacy laws including GDPR and CCPA.</li>
  <li>Scraping that places unreasonable load on third-party servers is prohibited.</li>
</ul>

<p>Kimberly Hudnall, trading as SiteVac, accepts no liability for any legal claims arising from a user's
decision to scrape any particular website. All such liability rests solely with the user.</p>

<h2>Customer Accountability</h2>

<p>We regard our customers as being responsible for their own actions as well as for the actions of
anyone using our Products with the customer's permission. This responsibility also applies to anyone
using our Products on an unauthorized basis as a result of the customer's failure to put in place
reasonable security measures.</p>

<p>By accepting Products from us, our customers agree to ensure adherence to this policy on behalf of
anyone using the Products as their end users. Complaints regarding the actions of customers or their
end-users will be forwarded to the nominated contact for the account in question.</p>

<p>If a customer — or their end-user or anyone using our Products as a result of the customer —
violates our acceptable use policy, we reserve the right to terminate any Products associated with the
offending account or the account itself or take any remedial or preventative action we deem appropriate
without notice. To the extent permitted by law, no credit will be available for interruptions of service
resulting from any violation of our acceptable use policy.</p>

  control laws.</li>
</ul>
<p>The customer is solely responsible for all material they input, upload, disseminate, transmit, create
or publish through or on our Products, and for obtaining legal permission to use any works included in
such material.</p>

sniffing, pinging, packet spoofing, flooding, mail-bombing and denial-of-service attacks.</p>

<p>Our Products must not be used to access any account or electronic resource where the group or
individual attempting to gain access does not own or is not authorized to access the resource
(e.g. "hacking", "cracking", "phreaking", etc.).</p>

of fraudulently gaining service, custom, patronage or user trust.</p>

<h2>About This Policy</h2>
